The Open Systems Interconnection model is standarized model that using layer<br>
to graphical description which is divided by 7 layer.<br>

Let's think step by step when we try to send a package to friend house.<br>
1. choose the present that we send.(layer 7)<br>
2. wrap the thing.(layer 6)<br>
3. put it inside the box.(layer 5)<br>
4. mark the address on the box.(layer 4)<br>
5. deliver the box to a warehouse.(layer 3)<br>
6. choose the transportation to deliver.(layer 2)<br>
7. start delivery on the road.(layer 1)<br>

From now, as perspective of package.<br>
1. package is delivered on the road.(layer 1)<br>
2. Use the transportation.(layer 2)<br>
3. deliver from warehouse to friend's house.(layer 3)<br>
4. friend get the box.(layer 4)<br>
5. unpack the box.(layer 5)<br>
6. unpack the cover.(layer 6)<br>
7. Get the present.(layer 7)<br>

So the layer 1 is **Physical layer**. the unit of data is **bit**.<br>
In the above example, it would be a road.<br>
physical layer transfers the **data** to electric signal vice versa.<br>
when we did not turn on the device or connect the cable, this layer has a problem.<br>
This layer include Wireless frequency, cable type, voltage and some other physical factor.<br>
Represented devices are Hub, Repeater, Cable.<br>

the layer 2 is **Data link layer**. the unit of data is **frame**(bunch of bit).<br>
Data link layer transfers the data to other device without error.<br>
This layer divided by two sublayer, MAX and LLC.<br>
MAC(Media Access Control) is used to find specific device to send a data.<br>
LLC(Logical Link Control) is used to connect the device logically and maintain the connection.<br>
Represented devices are Bridge, Switch.<br>

the layer 3 is **Network layer**. the unit of data is **packet**.<br>
Network link sends a packet using *fastest way*.<br>
This layer does not care about error because of above layer will take care about error.<br>
The objective of this layer is that find a fastest way to send a packet.<br>
We are using IP address in this layer.<br>
Represented devices are Router.<br>

the layer 4 is **Transport layer**. the unit of data is **segment**.<br>
Transport layer takes care about flow control and error recovery.<br>
It measn this layer ensure complete data transfer.<br>
There are two famous protocol in this layer, TCP(Transmission Control Protocol)<br>
, UDP(User Datagram Protocol). we will take a look later.<br>
Represented device is Gateway.<br>

the layer 5 is **Session layer**. the unit of data is **message**.<br>
Session layer is similar to transport layer. This layer manage, establish and terminate<br>
connections between *application*. There are three type of connection<br>
duplex(ex. radio), half duplex(ex. walkie talkie) and full duplex(ex. cell phone).<br>

This layer has responsibility to establish/termaninate TCP/UDP session.<br>

the layer 6 is **Presentation layer**. the unit of data is **messsage**.<br>
Presentation layer represents the translation of application format to network vice versa.<br>
JPG, GIF, JPEG are good examples of this area. This layer *present* data to appication or network.<br>

the layer 7 is **Application layer**. the unit of data is **message**.<br>
Application layer supports application and user processes.<br>
This layer focus on the appication, directly communicate with user.<br>
HTTP, FTP, Telnet and WWW browser are good example for this layer.<br>

Higher level layer take care about lowel level layer.<br>
interconnection on high level layer impacts on lowel lever layer.<br>
If Data create on application, every layer attach the information on the data to send properly.<br>

There are two important reason to use this model. Standard/Learning tool.<br>
For standard, even though this is abstract concept, it could explain lots of interconnection.<br>
Global Standard can reduce the cost and make easily people communicate about it.<br>
For Learning tool, you can learn when you chat with your friend via messenger.<br>
You can understand how it works and concept of interconnection.<br>

Actually nowadays OSI 7 layer model is quiet old one, so TCP/IP model is used a lot.<br>

You can see how the layer match to the TCP/IP model.<br>
TCP/IP model focus on abstarcting TCP/IP protocol.<br>
like OSI 7 layer, every layer take their data. dont' take care about other layer's data.<br>

It might be still abstract. Please leave some comments to how do you clarify those concept.<br>

Thank you.<br>
