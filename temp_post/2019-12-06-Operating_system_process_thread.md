This post is for the very beginner.<br>
What is the Operating System(OS)?<br>

Refer to Wikipedia, [An operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system)(OS) is system software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides common services for computer programs.<br>

Let's think about Messenger program. **Program** is the executable file set to do some task.<br>
so the Messenger Program is file set of communication via message.<br>
If you use window, click any messenger program and ctrl + alt + delete.<br>
You can see the messenger program is running on the list of process.

**Process** is <br>
1. Program that running on the OS continuously<br>
2. Task unit allocated system resources from OS<br>

Example of **System resoure** are <br>
1. CPU time.<br>
2. Memory address to running program.<br>
3. Region of memory structure composed code, data, stack and heap.<br>

You might be confused several new concept.<br>
Let's think about **Ironman**. he need to fight with enemy, run a business and save person at the same time.<br>

But he can do only one thing at once so he uses the **Ironman suit** to do all the task very quickly.<br>
So it looks everything is working at the same time for great effort of him<br>

Like this, One CPU Operating system shows hallucinations of many process running simultaneously<br>
to user with change the caring process quickly.<br>
How Operating system change the running process very quickly?<br>

Before we click the Messenger program, it is located in **disk memory** like SSD.<br>
It would be not proper comparing speed simply while Speed of SSD is 500 MB/s, CPU processor speed is 1GHz.<br>
It means Billions signal traverse the computer in one second.<br>

So it post
