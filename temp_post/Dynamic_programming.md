Dynamic programming is that devide a problem into smaller sub-problem, solve each sub problem<br>
and store solutions of each problem into arrary.<br>

It is not only computer programming method but also mathematical optimization method.<br>
As the perspective of Big O Analyze, to solve O(2^n), dynamic programming could be great way to solve the problem.<br>

There are a few famous way of Dynamic programming, let's take a look **Divide and Conquer** first.<br>
Please remember three simple rule of **Divide and Conquer**<br>
